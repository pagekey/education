# Sample App Node: NixOS Testbed

This folder allows you to test whether building the app from GitHub works without needing to actually change your NixOS system configuration. See the article in `../README.md` for more details.

## Getting Started

Run this command to build from GitHub:

```bash
nix-build
```

Then, you can run the built program with:

```bash
./result/bin/sample-app-node
```
